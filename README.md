# ALBERT-TINYBERT
This is a module build based on Albert with tensorflow2.0. I use Albert to train a Tinybert.
I changed albert ckpt of tensorflow1.0 to tensorflow2.0 which adapt to this projcet.
The albert and tinybert co-traing code in file run_pretraining.py.
This projcet is done by 2020.3, if someone need the code-use-guide, please leave the issue, I'd like to write a document.
